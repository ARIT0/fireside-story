		<p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
		<p>on the eve of Hurricane Dorian. Everyone stayed inside hoping not to bear the brunt of a cat 5 direct hit.</p>
		<p>The news showed terrible images of where the eye of the storm had previously passed. The Bahamas was 50% under water. Whenever the hurrican went next would likely bring great distruction.</p>
		<p>The models showed the hurrican slowing down. Where would it go? At this rate it was hard to know. Who would we hit next.</p>
